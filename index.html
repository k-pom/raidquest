<h3>Setup</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Each player chooses a class and takes all of their class cards</li>
    <li>Set the 3 Basic cards aside; that is your starting hand. Shuffle the rest together</li>
    <li>Shuffle the monsters together</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
Choose a random player to start. Play continues clockwise.
<ul>
    <li>Refresh: Reduce the cooldown of each card by one (see Cool down Positions). If it is already in position 1, it returns to your hand. </li>
    <li>Activate: Play an ability or item from hand. If it is an ability, but it in the appropriate cool down position. Limit one ability per turn.</li>
    <li>Attacked: Each minion in play attacks (as designated on the minion). Each minion will only attack once; if there is a tie to determine who to attack, the active player chooses which player is attacked.</li>
    <li>More Enemies: Put the top card of the minion deck in play. Skip this step if there are more minions than players </li>
</ul>

<h3>Leveling up and winning</h3>
If an action you played caused a minion to be destroyed (typically by placing enough damage to kill it), you get to level up! Draw the top card of your deck. The first player to level up to 10 (by drawing their entire deck) wins

<ul>
    <li>1 - Vertical</li>
    <li>3 - 90 Clockwise</li>

    <li>4 - 90 Counterclockwise</li>
</ul>
