<h3>Setup</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Each player chooses a class and takes all of their class cards</li>
    <li>Set the 3 Basic cards aside; that is your starting hand. Shuffle the rest together</li>
    <li>Shuffle the monsters together, and reveal a number of minions equal to the number of players</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
Choose a random player to start. Play continues clockwise.
<ul>
    <li>Refresh: Return all cards with 0 cooldown counters to your hand. Remove 1 counter from all of your cards in play. </li>
    <li>Activate: Each player may play an ability or item from hand. If it is an ability, place a number of cooldown counters on it equal to its cost. Limit one ability per turn.</li>
    <li>Attacked: Each minion in play attacks (as designated on the minion). Each minion will only attack once</li>
    <li>More Enemies: Put the top card of the minion deck in play. Skip this step if there are more minions than players </li>
</ul>

<h3>Leveling up and winning</h3>
<p>When a minion is killed, the party levels up! Each hero draws the top card of their deck and a new minion is played.</p>

<p>If everyone in the party is killed, the Minions win.</p>

<p>If the overlord (The Necromancer) is killed, the party wins.</p>
